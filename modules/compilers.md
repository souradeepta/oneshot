# Compilers and Interpreters
I think a valuable takeaway point for those interested in writing their own compiler is to use appropriate tools to get to the end goal as quickly as possible. Lexing, parsing, and code generation are all very interesting and challenging problems on their own. However, when writing your first compiler none of these stages should slow you down. Then, you can focus on the design of the internal representation and optimizations, which IMO will gain you better understanding of compilers.
